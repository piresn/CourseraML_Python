# Coursera's Machine Learning rewritten in Python

Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) is an excellent introduction to central concepts of machine learning. The course includes several exercises built upon Matlab / Octave code, but a much more interesting project was to rewrite and expand that code in Python.

These Jupyter notebooks are draft versions, unpolished, unreviewed and probably containing a few incorrections and inconsistencies.
