Andrew Ng's (Machine Learning course)[https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome] is an excellent introduction to central concepts of machine learning. The course includes several exercises built upon Matlab / Octave code, but a much more interesting project is to rewrite and expand that code in Python.

These Jupyter notebooks are draft versions, not at all polished and probably containing a few inconsistencies.
